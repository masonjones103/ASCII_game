# ASCII_game
Work in progress ASCII game.
I really don't know what I'm doing, I'm just messing around and trying to figure out how to do this for fun. 
If you have any tips, feel free to let me know.

## Running the game:
1.) Download Python 3 at https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.) Locate the game file in your file explorer.

3.) Open CMD and type:

```
py your\file\extension\game_main.py
```

For example, I would type: 

```
C:\Users\Mason\Documents\GitHub\ASCII_game\game_main.py
```

4.) Enjoy!
