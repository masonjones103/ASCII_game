# ASCII_game
Work in progress ASCII game.
I really don't know what I'm doing, I'm just messing around and trying to figure out how to do this for fun. 
If you have any tips, feel free to let me know.

## Running the game:
1.) Download Python 3 at https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.) Download and unzip the code.

3.) Locate the game file in your file explorer and double click on the game_main.py file to run, or continue to step 3.

4.) Open CMD and type:

```
py your\file\extension\game_main.py
```

For example, I would type: 

```
py C:\Users\Mason\Documents\GitHub\ASCII_game\game_main.py
```

5.) Enjoy!

## Playing the game:
1.) Press the highlighted key of the word you wish to choose. For example if I wanted to select (P)lay. I would type P.

2.) Press enter.

3.) Use WASD and enter to move around the dungeon.

4.) When fighting the goblin, choose (L)ight attack, (H)eavy attack, or (P)arry based off of what the opponent is doing.

## Combat cheat sheet:
Light beats heavy.

Heavy beats parry.

Parry beats light.

&nbsp;

Enemy light, player light = both take 1 dmg.

Enemy light, player heavy = player takes 1 dmg, player loses 3 energy.

Enemy light, player parry = enemy takes 1 dmg, player loses 1 energy.

Enemy heavy, player light = enemy takes 1 dmg, enemy loses 3 energy.
